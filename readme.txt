Our password reset plugin gives site administrators better tools around requiring users to reset their passwords.

== Description ==

This plugin includes both a timed password reset and a bulk password reset. The timed reset requires users to update their password every x amount of days. The bulk reset, however, requires users of a certain user level to reset their password, via a link sent to their email, on login and does not allow them to login until they've done so.
